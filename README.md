Here is a C realisation of a bash func "ls", that currently support flags:

  -R = list subdirectories recursively
  
  -a = do not ignore entries starting with '.'
  
  -l = use long listing format
  
  -i = print the index number of each file
  
 
In later updates i will add more flags

Verson:
  lags in -R are fixed
